This week 1 Million Cups presenters were governor.io and flyght club.

<a href="http://governor.io">governor.io</a>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>Still in Beta</li>
  <li>Plans are Free($0), Personal($10), Professional($25) per site</li>
  <li>Target users are Web developer who maintain sites for multiple clients</li>
</ul>
<br>
The first pitch was governor.io, a content management platform built with nodejs and mongodb on a lean stack.
This platform supposedly has all the benefits of other CMS like Wordpress and Squarespace and basic static pages without the drawback, I cannot verify since I have little exposure to all of them. There is a dashboard that allows the Web developer to view all their websites.

<a href="flyghtclub.net">Flyghtclub</a>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>App available for Android and iPhone</li>
    <li>For people that want someone to hang out during longs flights/layovers</li>
    <li>Free for users, data gathering</li>
    </ul>
Flyghtclub is an app that connects you with other fellow passengers during flights or layovers. Great idea if you are bored in an airport waiting for your plane. One issue that was brought up was that you need to create/register a profile to use the service. While not a bad thing, it might stop casual users from trying it.
